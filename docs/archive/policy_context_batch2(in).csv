**Category:** Project Level Narrative (Integrated Plan - IP)  
**Context:**  
The California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), in collaboration with behavioral health stakeholders and subject matter experts, has established 14 statewide behavioral health goals aimed at improving overall wellbeing (e.g., quality of life, social connection) and reducing adverse outcomes (e.g., suicides, overdoses). These goals are codified under Welfare & Institutions Code § 5963.02(c)(3)(A) and form the foundation for state and county behavioral health planning and resource prioritization under the Behavioral Health Transformation (BHT) initiative.

**Key Policy Elements:**  
- **Workforce Assessment and Planning:**  
  Counties are required to assess workforce gaps as part of their Integrated Plan (IP) submissions. This includes reporting on the number of behavioral health providers, current vacancies, and the county’s capacity to develop and maintain a robust workforce that ensures adequate access to behavioral health services aligned with the statewide goals.  
  - Counties no longer need to submit a separate Workforce Needs Assessment; workforce data must be integrated within the IP.  
  - Counties must include planned activities and projected expenditures related to workforce development, including efforts to increase racial, ethnic, and geographic diversity of the behavioral health workforce, incorporating individuals with lived experience to build cultural and linguistic competency.

- **Use of Data and Measures:**  
  DHCS will provide counties with population-level behavioral health measures linked to the 14 statewide goals. Counties must review these data to identify workforce-related gaps and disparities, including vacancy rates and workforce shortages, to inform their planning and interventions.  
  - Counties are encouraged to upload any data sources used to determine vacancy rates (optional file upload) to support transparency and data-driven planning.  
  - DHCS will continuously monitor county progress and provide technical assistance to support workforce development aligned with behavioral health goals.

- **Health Equity Focus:**  
  Health equity is a core principle embedded in all statewide behavioral health goals. Counties must consider disparities by demographic factors (e.g., age, race/ethnicity) in workforce planning and service delivery to reduce inequities affecting vulnerable populations.

- **Integration with Behavioral Health Services Act (BHSA) Funding and Reporting:**  
  Workforce strategy and related expenditures must be reported within the IP alongside other behavioral health services and funding streams (e.g., Medi-Cal, Realignment, Federal Block Grants).  
  - Workforce investment activities are reported separately from direct service expenditures within the IP budget templates.

**Summary of Requirements Related to Vacancy Rate Data Upload:**  
- While uploading data sources used to determine vacancy rates is optional, counties are expected to use such data to assess workforce gaps comprehensively.  
- Vacancy data should be incorporated into the narrative and planning sections of the IP to demonstrate the county’s understanding of workforce capacity challenges and planned strategies to address them.  
- This data-driven approach supports DHCS’s continuous improvement cycle and accountability framework for advancing statewide behavioral health goals.

The California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), in collaboration with behavioral health stakeholders and subject matter experts, has established 14 statewide behavioral health goals aimed at improving the overall well-being of Californians with behavioral health needs and reducing adverse outcomes such as suicides and overdoses. These goals form the foundation for state and county planning, resource allocation, and performance measurement under the Behavioral Health Transformation (BHT) initiative.

**Context and Purpose:**

- The workforce strategy is embedded within a broader population health approach to behavioral health, emphasizing quality of life, social connection, and health equity.
- Health equity is a core principle, defined as reducing or eliminating disparities that negatively impact vulnerable populations. DHCS requires that all behavioral health goals incorporate equity considerations, with data stratified by demographics (e.g., age, race/ethnicity) to identify and address disparities.
- Counties are expected to align their Integrated Plans (IPs) and annual updates with these statewide goals and use performance measures provided by DHCS to guide workforce development and service delivery improvements.
- The strategy recognizes the need for a culturally and linguistically competent workforce that reflects the racial, ethnic, and geographic diversity of the populations served, including the integration of individuals with lived experience.

**Specific Requirements and Efforts to Address Workforce Gaps:**

1. **Integrated Planning and Reporting:**
   - Counties must include workforce-related data and strategies in their IPs, covering provider numbers, vacancies, and capacity to meet behavioral health needs.
   - Separate Workforce Needs Assessments are no longer required beyond what is included in the IP.
   - Counties must report on efforts to build and maintain a robust behavioral health workforce aligned with statewide goals.

2. **Use of Behavioral Health Services Act (BHSA) Funds:**
   - Counties may use BHSA Workforce, Education, and Training (WET) funds to support activities that increase workforce diversity and cultural competence.
   - Funding can support continuing education, including online training platforms, to enhance workforce skills.

3. **Continuous Improvement and Accountability:**
   - DHCS will provide counties with performance measures related to the behavioral health goals and will engage counties in a continuous improvement cycle.
   - Counties, Medi-Cal Managed Care Plans (MCPs), and other stakeholders share responsibility for addressing workforce gaps as part of broader efforts to meet behavioral health goals.
   - DHCS will phase in requirements and provide technical assistance to support counties in workforce development aligned with population health management.

4. **Cross-System Collaboration:**
   - Addressing workforce gaps requires partnership across systems, including county behavioral health, MCPs, child welfare, public health, schools, and others.
   - Counties are encouraged to use community planning processes to engage stakeholders in workforce strategy development.

5. **Health Equity Focus:**
   - Workforce strategies must explicitly address disparities in access, quality, and outcomes by developing a workforce capable of serving diverse populations.
   - Efforts to diversify the workforce should be integrated across all WET activities.

**Summary:**

Counties are required to develop and implement workforce strategies that directly support the achievement of the 14 statewide behavioral health goals, with a strong emphasis on health equity and cultural competence. These strategies must be incorporated into the county Integrated Plan and include data-driven approaches to identify and address workforce gaps. DHCS supports counties through performance measurement, technical assistance, and funding opportunities, fostering a coordinated, cross-system effort to build a diverse, skilled behavioral health workforce capable of meeting the needs of California’s populations.","### Summary for County Response: Addressing Workforce Gaps Beyond BHSA WET Efforts
