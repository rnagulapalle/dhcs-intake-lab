---

#### Context and Background

- **Standard Funding Requirement:**  
  Counties receiving Behavioral Health Services Act (BHSA) funds must allocate **30% of their Behavioral Health Services Fund (BHSF)** to the Housing Interventions component.

- **Within Housing Interventions:**  
  - **50% of Housing Interventions funds** must be used specifically for services targeting **persons who are chronically homeless**, with an emphasis on those living in encampments.  
  - **No more than 25%** of Housing Interventions funds may be used for **capital development projects**.

- **Flexibility and Exemptions:**  
  State law (W&I Code § 5892) allows counties to request **exemptions** to these spending requirements if they seek to allocate funds differently than the standard percentages, especially beyond the 7% transfer allowance.

---

#### Exemption Request Eligibility and Process

- **Who can request exemptions?**  
  - Counties with populations **under 200,000** may request exemptions starting with the **2026-29 Fiscal Years’ Integrated Plan (IP)**.  
  - All counties, regardless of size, may request exemptions starting with the **2032-35 Fiscal Years’ IP**.

- **Submission Requirements:**  
  - Exemption requests must be submitted as part of the **draft Integrated Plan (IP)** by **March 31** of the year prior to the fiscal years covered.  
  - Requests must include a letter from the **County Administrative Officer** approving the draft IP and exemption requests.  
  - Requests must be supported by **data and evidence** demonstrating the need for exemption, such as:  
    - Point in Time Count (PIT)  
    - Housing Inventory Count (HIC)  
    - Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) data  
    - Coordinated Entry System data  
    - Electronic Health Record data  

- **DHCS Review and Approval:**  
  - The Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) reviews exemption requests against established criteria and has **30 calendar days** to approve or deny the request.  
  - Exemptions are valid only for the duration of the three-year IP and must be renewed with each subsequent IP submission.

---

#### Criteria for Exemption Requests Related to Housing Intervention Funds

1. **Percentage of BHSF funds allocated to Housing Interventions (normally 30%)**  
   - Requests to increase or decrease this percentage must demonstrate:  
     - Very significant or very limited local need (e.g., size of eligible population).  
     - Availability or insufficiency of other funding sources to meet housing needs.  
     - Other relevant considerations supported by evidence.

2. **Percentage of Housing Interventions funds used for chronically homeless (normally 50%)**  
   - Requests to reduce this percentage must demonstrate:  
     - Very limited need for chronic homelessness services locally.  
     - Sufficient alternative funding sources addressing chronic homelessness.  
     - Other considerations with supporting evidence.

3. **Percentage of Housing Interventions funds used for capital development (normally no more than 25%)**  
   - Requests to increase this percentage must demonstrate:  
     - Significant capital development needs to meet housing demands.  
     - Insufficiency of other funding sources for capital projects.  
     - Other considerations with detailed budget and supporting documentation.

---

#### Additional Policy Considerations

- **Coordination with Medi-Cal Managed Care Plans (MCPs):**  
  Housing Interventions funds **cannot be used for housing services covered by MCPs**. Counties must coordinate with MCPs to ensure BHSA funds complement, not supplant, MCP-covered housing-related Community Supports.

- **Purpose of Housing Interventions Funding:**  
  To develop behavioral health housing programs that increase access to permanent supportive housing for BHSA-eligible individuals who are chronically homeless, experiencing homelessness, or at risk of homelessness.

- **Integration with Other Housing Initiatives:**  
  Housing Interventions funding is designed to build upon and complement other state and local housing programs (e.g., Homekey+, No Place Like Home, Behavioral Health Bridge Housing).

---

### Direct Answer to Question 1a:

**What percentage of funds is the county requesting to utilize for the Housing Intervention Component?**

- The **standard requirement is 30% of the Behavioral Health Services Fund (BHSF)** must be allocated to Housing Interventions.  
- If a county requests an exemption to use a different percentage (higher or lower than 30%), it must submit an exemption request with supporting data and justification as described above.  
- The exemption request is subject to DHCS approval and must be included in the draft Integrated Plan by March 31 prior to the fiscal years covered.

---

### Summary

Counties are generally required to allocate **30% of their BHSF funds to Housing Interventions**, with **50% of those funds dedicated to chronically homeless populations**. Counties may request exemptions to adjust these percentages if justified by local needs and funding realities, supported by data, and approved by DHCS. Exemptions are submitted as part of the Integrated Plan and are valid for three years. Coordination with Medi-Cal Managed Care Plans is required to avoid duplication of housing services funding.","### Summary: Percentage of Funds County is Requesting to Utilize for Housing Intervention Component

- Of the Housing Interventions funds, **50% must be used for persons who are chronically homeless**.
- No more than **25% of Housing Interventions funds may be used for capital development projects**.

However, state law permits counties to request **exemptions** from these spending requirements if they meet certain criteria, allowing adjustments beyond the standard 7% transfer allowance.

---

**Eligibility and Timing for Exemption Requests:**

- Counties with populations **under 200,000** may request exemptions starting with the **2026-29 Fiscal Years’ IP**.
- All counties, regardless of size, may request exemptions starting with the **2032-35 Fiscal Years’ IP**.
- Exemption requests must be submitted as part of the **draft IP by March 31** of the year prior to the fiscal years covered.
- Requests must include a letter of approval from the County Administrative Officer.
- Exemptions are valid only for the duration of the three-year IP and must be resubmitted for subsequent plans.

**In essence, the policy provides a structured, data-driven process for counties to request flexibility in Housing Intervention funding allocations, ensuring that exemptions are justified by local needs and supported by comprehensive data and community input.**","### Summary: Housing Intervention Exemption Request #1 – Behavioral Health Services Fund (BHSF) Housing Intervention Component  
**Category: Chronic Homelessness**  

---

#### Context and Purpose  
Under California Welfare & Institutions Code § 5892, counties receiving BHSF funds for Housing Interventions may request exemptions from mandated spending requirements to better address local behavioral health and housing needs, especially for chronically homeless populations. These exemptions provide flexibility beyond the standard 7% transfer allowance and require robust supporting data.

---

#### Key Statutory and Policy Requirements  

- **Funding Allocations & Exemptions (W&I Code § 5892):**  
  - **30% Minimum Allocation:** Counties must allocate at least 30% of BHSF funds to Housing Interventions but may request exemptions based on local need and funding availability.  
  - **50% Minimum Allocation to Chronically Homeless:** At least half of Housing Intervention funds must serve chronically homeless individuals; exemptions require justification with local data.  
  - **25% Maximum for Capital Development:** Capital projects cannot exceed 25% of Housing Intervention funds unless exempted with detailed justification.  

- **Eligibility & Operational Standards:**  
  - Housing Interventions must comply with Housing First principles (W&I Code § 8255), emphasizing immediate housing access without preconditions.  
  - Eligible populations include those experiencing chronic homelessness as defined by W&I Code § 5891.  
  - Housing funds cannot supplant Medi-Cal Managed Care Plan services and must complement existing resources.  

- **Exemption Request Process:**  
  - Requests must be submitted with the county’s Integrated Plan (IP) draft by March 31 prior to the fiscal years covered.  
  - Must include a certification letter from the County Administrative Officer (CAO).  
  - DHCS reviews requests within 30 calendar days; lack of response equals approval. Appeals are allowed within 30 days.  

---

#### Supporting Data and Documentation Requirements for Exemption Requests (Per Policy and Statute)  

- **Quantitative Data:**  
  - Point-in-Time Count (PIT)  
  - Housing Inventory Count (HIC)  
  - Homeless Management Information System (HMIS)  
  - Coordinated Entry System data  
  - Electronic Health Records or other relevant local data  

- **Qualitative Evidence:**  
  - Rationale for exemption based on local prevalence, funding gaps, or other evidence-based considerations.  
  - Documentation of community planning and stakeholder engagement processes.  

- **Certifications:**  
  - Signed assurances from the CAO and Behavioral Health Director confirming compliance with fiscal accountability and legal requirements.  

- **Additional Documentation (if applicable):**  
  - Detailed budgets, partnership agreements, letters of support for capital development exemption requests.  

---

#### Summary for Compliance and Completeness  
To fully address the question and ensure compliance, counties must upload supporting data that:  

- Demonstrates the local chronic homelessness prevalence and needs using mandated data sources.  
- Provides clear justification for exemption requests grounded in local conditions and funding realities.  
- Includes evidence of community involvement and planning.  
- Contains official certifications from county leadership.  
- Supplies detailed financial and partnership documentation if requesting capital development exemptions.  

This structured, data-driven approach aligns with statutory mandates and DHCS policy to facilitate timely review and approval of exemption requests."

This summary strictly focuses on statutes that address requirements for data sources and supporting documentation for Housing Intervention exemption requests at the project level narrative.","**Policy Summary: Section Topic Exemption Requests – Housing Intervention Exemption Request #1 (Behavioral Health Services Fund Housing Intervention Component – Supporting Data #1, Category: Project Level Narrative)**

---

### Context and Purpose

Counties receiving Behavioral Health Services Act (BHSA) funds for Housing Interventions are generally required to allocate:

- **At least 30%** of BHSA funds to Housing Interventions,
- **At least 50%** of Housing Intervention funds to chronically homeless individuals,
- **No more than 25%** of Housing Intervention funds to capital development projects.

However, **counties may request exemptions** from these requirements if they can demonstrate that local conditions justify adjustments to these percentages. Exemptions allow counties to better align funding with local needs and resources, especially when the statutory thresholds do not reflect the actual housing needs or funding landscape in their jurisdiction.

---

### Eligibility and Submission Process

- **Eligibility:**  
  - All counties are exempt from certain Full Service Partnership (FSP) requirements for FY 2026-2029.  
  - Counties with populations under 200,000 may request Housing Intervention and FSP exemptions starting with the FY 2026-2029 Integrated Plan (IP).  
  - All counties, regardless of size, may request exemptions starting FY 2029-2032 IP.

- **Submission:**  
  - Exemption requests must be submitted through the county portal as part of the draft IP by **March 31** of the fiscal year prior to the IP period (e.g., March 31, 2026 for FY 2026-2029).  
  - Requests must be accompanied by a letter of approval from the County Administrative Officer.  
  - Exemptions are valid only for the three-year IP period and must be resubmitted for subsequent plans.

---

### Criteria for Exemption Requests

Counties must provide **supporting data and narrative** demonstrating that exemption criteria are met. The criteria vary by exemption type:

1. **30% Minimum Allocation to Housing Interventions**  
   - Request to increase or decrease this percentage beyond the 7% transfer allowance must be justified by:  
     - Very significant or limited local need (e.g., size of eligible population).  
     - Availability or insufficiency of other funding sources addressing housing needs.  
     - Other relevant considerations supported by evidence.

  - Very limited need (e.g., small number of eligible chronically homeless individuals).
  - Sufficient funding from other sources addressing chronic homelessness.
  - Other evidence-based considerations.
  
- **Increased percentage requests** (if applicable) would require evidence of greater need or insufficient alternative funding.

Counties must provide supporting data such as:

- Point in Time Count (PIT)
- Housing Inventory Count (HIC)
- Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) data
- Coordinated Entry System data
- Electronic Health Record data

---

### DHCS Review and Approval Process

- DHCS has **30 calendar days** to approve or deny exemption requests after submission.
- If no response is received within 30 days, the exemption is considered approved.
- Counties may appeal denials within 30 days, with DHCS having 30 days to respond to appeals.
- Approved exemptions are valid only for the duration of the three-year IP and must be resubmitted for subsequent plans.

---

### Key Takeaway Regarding the Percentage of Funds for Chronically Homeless

- **By default, counties are required to allocate 50 percent of their Housing Interventions funds to chronically homeless individuals.**
- Counties may request an exemption to use a different percentage, but must provide substantial evidence demonstrating the need for such an adjustment.
- The exemption process is formal, time-bound, and requires DHCS approval.

---

### Summary Answer to Question 1a

**What percentage of funds is the county requesting to use for those who are chronically homeless?**

- The standard policy requires **50 percent of Housing Interventions funds** to be used for chronically homeless persons.
- If a county requests an exemption (Housing Intervention Exemption Request #2), it is to adjust this 50 percent requirement either upward or downward.
- The exact percentage requested by a county would be specified in their exemption request submitted with the draft IP.
- Without a specific county exemption request document, the policy default is 50 percent, subject to approved exemptions.

**Context:**

Under the Behavioral Health Services Act (BHSA), counties are required to allocate a portion of their Behavioral Health Services Fund (BHSF) to Housing Interventions (HI) programs. Specifically:

- **30% of BHSF funds** must be spent on Housing Interventions.
- Of those Housing Interventions funds, **50% must be used for persons who are chronically homeless**, with a focus on those living in encampments.
- No more than **25% of Housing Interventions funds** may be used for capital development projects.

State law (W&I Code § 5892) allows counties to request exemptions from these spending requirements if they can demonstrate that the standard allocations do not fit their local needs or circumstances. These exemptions are particularly relevant when counties seek adjustments beyond the 7% funding transfer allowance.

---

**Eligibility and Timing for Exemption Requests:**

- Counties with populations **under 200,000** may request exemptions starting with the **2026-29 Fiscal Years’ Integrated Plan (IP)**.
- All counties, regardless of size, may request exemptions starting with the **2032-35 Fiscal Years’ IP**.
- Exemption requests must be submitted as part of the **draft IP by March 31** of the year prior to the fiscal years covered.
- Requests must include a letter of approval from the County Administrative Officer.
- Exemptions are valid only for the duration of the three-year IP and must be resubmitted for subsequent plans.

---

**Exemption Criteria for Housing Intervention Funds Directed to Chronically Homeless (50% Requirement):**

Counties may request to reduce the required 50% allocation for chronically homeless individuals if they meet one or more of the following criteria:

1. **Very Limited Need:**  
   - The county has a small number of BHSA-eligible individuals experiencing chronic homelessness.  
   - Evidence may include data from Point in Time Counts (PIT), Housing Inventory Counts (HIC), Homeless Management Information System (HMIS), Coordinated Entry System data, or Electronic Health Records.

2. **Sufficient Funding from Other Sources:**  
   - The county has adequate alternative funding streams addressing the housing needs of chronically homeless individuals, reducing the need to allocate BHSA Housing Interventions funds specifically for this population.

3. **Other Considerations:**  
   - Counties may present other relevant factors supported by evidence and subject to DHCS review.

---

**Process and Review:**

- Counties must provide data and documentation supporting their exemption request aligned with the above criteria.
- DHCS reviews exemption requests within **30 calendar days** of submission via the county portal.
- If DHCS does not respond within 30 days, the exemption is considered approved.
- Counties may appeal denials within 30 days, with DHCS having 30 days to respond to appeals.
- If denied, counties must update their IP to reflect the denial by June 30 prior to the fiscal years covered.

---

**Additional Policy Considerations:**

- Housing Interventions funds **cannot be used for services covered by Medi-Cal Managed Care Plans (MCPs)**; counties must coordinate with MCPs to avoid supplanting and ensure complementary use of funds.
- The exemption process is designed to provide counties flexibility to tailor Housing Interventions funding to local needs while maintaining accountability and data-driven justification.
- The focus on chronically homeless individuals, especially those in encampments, aligns with federal definitions and priorities to address the most vulnerable populations.

- **Purpose:** Exemptions allow counties to adjust Housing Interventions funding allocations beyond the standard 7% transfer limit, reflecting local needs and circumstances.
- **Eligibility & Timing:**
  - Counties with populations under 200,000 may begin requesting exemptions starting with the 2026-29 Fiscal Years’ Integrated Plan (IP).
  - All counties, regardless of size, may request exemptions starting with the 2032-35 Fiscal Years’ IP.
  - Exemption requests must be submitted as part of the draft IP by **March 31** of the year prior to the fiscal years covered.
  - Requests must include a letter of approval from the County Administrative Officer.

---

### Exemption Categories and Criteria

Counties may request exemptions from one or more of the following Housing Interventions requirements:

1. **30% Minimum Allocation of Behavioral Health Subaccount (BHSF) Funds to Housing Interventions**
   - Criteria for exemption (increase or decrease):
     - Very significant or limited local need (e.g., size of eligible population).
     - Availability or insufficiency of other funding sources.
     - Other considerations supported by evidence.
   - Supporting data examples: Point in Time Count (PIT), Housing Inventory Count (HIC), Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) data, Coordinated Entry System data, Electronic Health Records, etc.

2. **50% Minimum Allocation of Housing Interventions Funds to Chronically Homeless Individuals**

Under California Welfare & Institutions Code § 5892, counties receiving Behavioral Health Subaccount (BHSA) funds for Housing Interventions are generally required to allocate no more than 25% of their Housing Interventions funds toward capital development projects (e.g., construction or rehabilitation of housing units). However, state law permits counties to request exemptions to this limit when justified by local needs and circumstances.

Exemptions are necessary when counties seek to adjust their Housing Interventions spending beyond the standard limits (such as the 7% transfer allowance). Counties with populations under 200,000 may begin requesting exemptions starting with the 2026-29 Integrated Plan (IP) cycle, while all counties regardless of size may request exemptions starting with the 2032-35 IP cycle.

---

### Eligibility and Submission Process

- **Who can request:** Counties eligible under population thresholds and timing as noted above.
- **When to submit:** Exemption requests must be submitted as part of the draft Integrated Plan by March 31 of the year prior to the fiscal years covered by the IP.
- **Approval:** Requests require approval by the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), which has 30 calendar days to approve or deny. If no response is received within 30 days, the exemption is considered approved.
- **Appeals:** Counties may appeal denials within 30 days, with DHCS having 30 days to respond to appeals.

---

### Criteria for Capital Development Exemption Requests (Exemption Request #3)

Counties requesting to exceed the 25% capital development funding limit must demonstrate that:

1. **Significant capital development is required to meet housing needs of the eligible population**, evidenced by a demonstrated lack of existing suitable housing facilities within the county. This may include data such as Point in Time Counts (PIT), Housing Inventory Counts (HIC), Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) data, or other relevant local housing needs assessments.

2. **Other funding sources are insufficient to address the need**, meaning that federal, state, local, or private funding streams do not adequately cover the capital development requirements for permanent supportive housing (PSH) or affordable housing for BHSA-eligible individuals.

3. **Costs of accessibility improvements exceed the 25% capital improvement limits**, if applicable. This includes situations where necessary accessibility modifications (e.g., ADA compliance) push capital costs beyond typical thresholds.

4. **Other considerations**, subject to evidence requirements and DHCS review, may also be presented to justify the exemption.

---

### Documentation Requirements

Requests must include detailed supporting documentation such as:

- A detailed budget with funding breakdowns.
- Partnership agreements or letters of support.
- Evidence of housing production needs.
- Data demonstrating the lack of existing suitable housing.
- Information on other funding sources and their insufficiency.
- Any other relevant data supporting the exemption criteria.

---

### Capital Development Project Requirements (If Exemption Approved)

- Housing units must be affordable and meet the definition of supportive housing per California Government Code § 65582(g).
- Units must be made available to eligible individuals and families as defined in the BHSA program.
- Access cannot be limited to individuals enrolled in Full Service Partnerships (FSP) or Medi-Cal.
- Projects must comply with Housing First principles and nondiscrimination policies, including for individuals using medications for addiction treatment.
- Counties may accrue capital development funds over multiple years to cover project costs, subject to reversion rules.
- The maximum capital development funding per unit is capped at $450,000.
- Projects must comply with all DHCS requirements and reversion periods (3- and 5-year).

---

### Summary of Multi-Select Criteria for Housing Intervention Exemptions (Relevant to Question 1b)

Counties may select one or more of the following criteria when requesting exemptions related to capital development:

- **i. Significant capital development required to meet housing needs of eligible population** (e.g., demonstrated lack of existing suitable housing facilities).
- **ii. Other funding sources insufficient to address need**.
- **iii. Costs of accessibility improvements exceed 25 percent capital improvement limits**.
- **iv. Other** (with narrative explanation and supporting evidence).

---

### Additional Notes

- Housing Interventions funds must not supplant Medi-Cal Managed Care Plan (MCP) covered housing services; counties must coordinate with MCPs to ensure complementary use of funds.
- Exemptions are valid only for the three-year IP cycle and must be resubmitted for subsequent cycles.
- DHCS reviews exemption requests in the context of local needs and statewide policy goals to maximize housing outcomes for BHSA-eligible populations.

---

**In essence, the policy allows counties to request an exemption to exceed the 25% capital development funding limit for Housing Interventions when significant unmet housing needs exist, other funding is insufficient, or accessibility costs are unusually high, subject to DHCS approval and supported by robust local data and documentation.**","### Summary: Housing Intervention Exemption Request #3 – Housing Intervention Funds for Capital Development

- Exemptions are valid only for the duration of the three-year IP and must be resubmitted for subsequent plans.

---

### Justification for Exemption Requests (Summary for Question 1c):

Counties requesting an exemption to exceed the 25% capital development funding limit must justify the request by demonstrating:

- A **significant unmet need for capital development** to provide permanent supportive or affordable housing for BHSA-eligible individuals.
- The **absence or insufficiency of existing housing stock** suitable for the target population.
- The **lack of adequate alternative funding sources** to cover capital development costs.
- Supporting data such as Point in Time Counts (PIT), Housing Inventory Counts (HIC), Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) data, and other relevant local housing and health data.
- Detailed project plans and budgets showing how the additional capital funds will be used efficiently and effectively to increase housing capacity.

---

### Additional Considerations:

- Housing Interventions funds **cannot supplant Medi-Cal Managed Care Plan (MCP) covered housing services**; counties must coordinate with MCPs to ensure complementary use of funds.
- Capital development projects funded through Housing Interventions should aim to increase the supply of permanent supportive housing (PSH) or affordable housing to improve housing stability for individuals with behavioral health needs.
- Counties are encouraged to use innovative and cost-effective approaches in capital development.

---

### Summary:

The policy allows counties to request exemptions to exceed the 25% cap on capital development spending within Housing Interventions funds when justified by significant unmet housing needs and insufficient alternative funding. The exemption process requires detailed documentation, local planning, and DHCS approval, ensuring that funds are used strategically to expand permanent supportive housing for vulnerable populations.","### Summary for Justification of Housing Intervention Exemption Request #3

The policy governing stakeholder engagement in the community planning process for the Integrated Plan (IP) emphasizes meaningful, inclusive, and ongoing involvement of diverse stakeholders throughout the development, review, and implementation of the plan. This is mandated by various Welfare & Institutions (W&I) Code sections, notably §§ 14184.101(j), 5963.03(a)(2)(A)(i-ii), and related provisions.

**Context and Purpose:**  
Counties are required to engage a broad and diverse range of stakeholders to ensure that the Integrated Plan reflects community-identified strengths, needs, and priorities related to behavioral health services. Stakeholder engagement is a critical component of the community planning process and must be demonstrably meaningful, not merely perfunctory.

**Key Requirements and Elements:**

1. **Broad and Inclusive Stakeholder Participation:**  
   - Engagement must include individuals with lived experience (eligible adults, older adults, youth, families), providers, public safety partners, education and health agencies, veterans, culturally and linguistically diverse groups, and other community representatives.  
   - Stakeholders should represent diverse viewpoints, including marginalized populations such as LGBTQ+ communities, victims of domestic violence, people with lived experience of homelessness, and racial/ethnic minorities.  
   - Engagement is not limited to organizational representatives or advocacy groups but must include direct constituent involvement.

2. **Meaningful Partnership and Opportunities for Feedback:**  
   - Counties must demonstrate ongoing partnerships with stakeholders throughout the planning process, including policy, program planning, implementation, monitoring, quality improvement, workforce development, and budget allocation.  
   - Stakeholders must have opportunities to provide input on key planning decisions, ensuring their voices influence the IP content and priorities.

3. **Variety of Engagement Methods:**  
   Counties are encouraged to use multiple strategies to facilitate meaningful involvement, such as:  
   - Listening sessions, town halls, public hearings, and client advisory meetings  
   - Stakeholder workgroups, focus groups, surveys, and key informant interviews  
   - Virtual engagement tools, media announcements, targeted outreach  
   - Training, education, and technical assistance to support stakeholder understanding and participation

4. **Staffing and Support for Engagement:**  
   - Counties should designate staff or units responsible for managing and coordinating the community planning process and ensuring stakeholder participation.  
   - Training must be provided to staff to sustain effective engagement processes.  
   - Supports such as stipends, childcare, transportation, translation services, and technology may be provided to reduce barriers to participation.

5. **Funding for Planning and Engagement:**  
   - Counties may allocate up to 5% of their Behavioral Health Services Fund (BHSF) revenue to cover planning costs, including stakeholder participation expenses and infrastructure to support engagement.

6. **Coordination with Local Health Jurisdictions (LHJs):**  
   - Counties should coordinate IP stakeholder engagement with LHJ processes (Community Health Assessments and Improvement Plans) to reduce duplication and community fatigue while ensuring behavioral health needs are addressed.

7. **Documentation and Transparency:**  
   - Counties must document stakeholder engagement activities (e.g., meeting minutes, public comments) to demonstrate how diverse viewpoints informed the IP development.  
   - The IP must be circulated for a 30-day public comment period and reviewed by the local behavioral health board before final submission.

**Summary:**  
The policy mandates that counties conduct a transparent, inclusive, and well-supported community planning process that actively incorporates diverse stakeholder input into the Integrated Plan. Counties must provide multiple avenues for engagement, ensure meaningful participation beyond organizational representatives, allocate adequate resources and staffing, and document how stakeholder feedback shapes the plan. This approach ensures the IP reflects community priorities and promotes equity in behavioral health service planning and delivery.","**Summary: Stakeholder Engagement in the Community Planning Process for the Integrated Plan**

This policy guidance addresses the requirements for counties submitting their Behavioral Health Services Act (BHSA) Integrated Plans (IPs) regarding collaboration with Local Health Jurisdictions (LHJs) on Community Health Assessments (CHAs) and Community Health Improvement Plans (CHIPs). It reflects recent policy developments, including the 2024 DHCS redesign of Managed Care Plan (MCP) Population Needs Assessment (PNA) requirements, and aims to promote alignment and integration among public health, managed care, and behavioral health systems.

---

### Key Policy Context and Background

- **LHJ CHA and CHIP:**  
  - Most LHJs develop CHAs and CHIPs as part of their local public health planning.  
  - The **CHA** describes the population health status within the jurisdiction.  
  - The **CHIP**, informed by the CHA, outlines strategies to address key community health issues through collaboration with community partners.  
  - These processes emphasize community participation and are tailored to local needs without mandated topic areas (e.g., mental health is optional but may be included).  
  - LHJs typically update CHAs and CHIPs every 3 to 5 years; starting 2028, all LHJs will follow a standardized 3-year cycle and mandatory submission.

- **MCP PNA Alignment:**  
  - Since January 2024, MCPs fulfill their PNA requirement by meaningfully participating in LHJ CHA and CHIP development rather than submitting separate PNAs.  
  - MCPs must collaborate with LHJs and other MCPs in their service areas to unify planning efforts.

- **BHSA County IP Requirements:**  
  - Counties must work with LHJs on CHIP development and consider LHJ CHIPs when preparing their IPs and annual updates (W&I Code §§ 5963.01(b), 5963.02(b)(4)).  
  - Counties must also work with MCPs on MCP PNA development (now integrated with LHJ CHA/CHIP) and consider MCP PNAs in IP preparation (W&I Code §§ 5963.01(a), 5963.02(b)(3)).  
  - Counties’ IPs must reflect collaboration with LHJs and MCPs to promote integrated upstream interventions and population health improvements.

---

### Specific Requirements for Counties (Effective January 2025)

Counties are required to engage with LHJs and MCPs on CHAs and CHIPs across **three key areas**:

1. **Collaboration:**

   - Counties should participate in CHA/CHIP meetings and governance structures, especially when behavioral health topics are discussed.  
   - Collaboration should align with MCP meaningful participation requirements.

2. **Data Sharing:**  
   - Counties, LHJs, and MCPs must collaborate to share relevant data to create a comprehensive understanding of community health needs.  
   - Data sharing should respect privacy laws and consider de-identification or disaggregation as needed.  
   - Counties must continue to meet broader IP data requirements beyond what LHJ CHA/CHIP data provide.

3. **Stakeholder Engagement:**  
   - Counties should coordinate IP stakeholder engagement with LHJ CHA/CHIP processes to reduce duplication and community fatigue.  
   - Counties must consider input from diverse populations and community stakeholders involved in LHJ processes.  
   - Counties must still fulfill any additional BHSA stakeholder engagement requirements not covered by LHJ processes.

---

### Flexibility and Exceptions

- **Cities Submitting IPs Independently:**  
  - Cities submitting their Integrated Plans independently from their counties are **not required** to complete this LHJ collaboration section.

- **W&I Code § 5892 (e)(1)**","### Policy Summary: Community Planning Process – Local Health Jurisdiction (LHJ)  
**Category: Challenges and Concerns**  
**Context:**  
This policy guidance addresses the requirements for counties’ Integrated Plan (IP) submissions under the Behavioral Health Services Act (BHSA), specifically focusing on collaboration with Local Health Jurisdictions (LHJs) and Medi-Cal Managed Care Plans (MCPs) in the development and alignment of Community Health Assessments (CHAs) and Community Health Improvement Plans (CHIPs). The goal is to promote greater integration and alignment among public health, managed care, and behavioral health systems to improve population health outcomes through upstream interventions and coordinated strategies.

---

### Key Policy Context and Background:  
- **LHJs’ Role:** Most LHJs develop CHAs and CHIPs as part of their local public health planning. These processes emphasize community collaboration and participation, tailored to local needs without mandated topic areas. CHAs describe population health status; CHIPs outline strategies to address key issues identified in CHAs.  
- **MCPs’ Role:** Since January 2024, MCPs fulfill their Population Needs Assessment (PNA) requirements by meaningfully participating in LHJ CHAs and CHIPs rather than submitting separate PNAs. MCPs collaborate with LHJs and other MCPs in their service areas to unify planning efforts.  
- **BHSA Requirements:** Counties must work with LHJs and MCPs in developing their IPs, considering LHJ CHIPs and MCP PNAs (now integrated into LHJ CHA/CHIP processes). Counties must align their behavioral health planning with these local public health and managed care efforts.

---

### Specific County Requirements (Effective January 2025):  
Counties are required to engage with LHJs and MCPs across **three key areas** in developing their IPs, with flexibility allowed to address unique local needs:

1. **Collaboration:**  
   - Counties must work with LHJs and MCPs on the development of CHAs and CHIPs, fulfilling meaningful participation requirements.  
   - Counties should attend CHA/CHIP meetings and participate in governance structures or subcommittees when behavioral health topics are relevant.  
   - Collaboration aims to coordinate upstream interventions and improve population health through joint strategies.

2. **Data-Sharing:**  
   - Counties, LHJs, and MCPs each hold siloed data; sharing this data creates a holistic view of community health factors.  
   - Counties must collaborate with LHJs and MCPs to identify relevant data types to share, considering the nature of CHAs/CHIPs and privacy laws (e.g., HIPAA, consent requirements).  
   - Data should support behavioral health focus areas and inform IP development, including stratification and de-identification as needed.  
   - Counties must also meet broader IP data requirements beyond what LHJ/MCP data sharing provides.

3. **Stakeholder Engagement:**  
   - Counties must coordinate stakeholder engagement efforts with LHJs to reduce duplication and community fatigue.  
   - Counties should integrate IP stakeholder activities with CHA/CHIP processes where possible, considering input from diverse populations and over twenty specific stakeholder groups identified by BHSA.  
   - Behavioral health may be a key focus area identified through CHA/CHIP community input, which counties should incorporate into their IPs.  
   - Counties must still fulfill any additional stakeholder engagement requirements not covered by LHJ processes.

---

### Additional Policy Considerations and Challenges:  
- **Disparate Submission Cycles:** LHJs currently have varying CHA/CHIP submission cycles (mostly every 5 years, some every 3 years), which may not align with county IP timelines. Counties should use the most recent CHA/CHIP available or consult LHJs for strategic plans if CHAs/CHIPs are unavailable.  
- **Flexibility:** Given local variation in needs and focus areas, DHCS allows counties flexibility in how they collaborate with LHJs and MCPs, recognizing that behavioral health topics may differ by jurisdiction.  
- **No Funding Mandate:** Counties are not required to provide funding or in-kind staffing to support LHJ CHA/CHIP processes, though MCPs have some funding/staffing obligations per PHM Policy Guide.  
- **Future Alignment:** Starting in 2028, CHAs and CHIPs will be mandatory for all LHJs on a standardized three-year cycle to better align with county IP and MCP PNA processes, facilitating improved integration and collaboration.  
- **Technical Assistance:** DHCS plans to develop a “County-LHJ-MCP Collaboration Tool” to support these partnerships in collaboration, data sharing, and stakeholder engagement.

---

### Summary for Narrative Response to Question 2:  
Counties engaged with LHJs and MCPs in developing CHAs and CHIPs through structured collaboration, data-sharing, and stakeholder engagement activities. Counties participated in CHA/CHIP meetings and governance, coordinated data exchange respecting privacy laws to inform behavioral health priorities, and aligned stakeholder outreach efforts to reduce duplication and incorporate diverse community input. While counties tailored their approaches to local needs and timelines, they worked within DHCS guidance to promote integrated upstream interventions and population health strategies. This collaboration supports the BHSA mandate to align behavioral health planning with public health and managed care efforts, advancing health equity and improving community outcomes.

   - Counties must select relevant goals that align with their local behavioral health focus areas and use shared data to support these goals in CHA/CHIP development and IP submissions.

3. **Use of Data for Integrated Plan (IP) Development**

   - Counties must utilize and stratify data obtained from LHJs and MCPs to inform the development of their Integrated Plans.
   - Data stratification should enable visibility into disparities by demographics such as age, race/ethnicity, and other factors to address health equity.
   - Counties remain responsible for meeting any broader data requirements for IP development that may not be fulfilled solely through LHJ CHA and CHIP data.

4. **Stakeholder Engagement Alignment**

   - Counties should coordinate stakeholder engagement activities for IP development with LHJ CHA and CHIP processes to reduce duplication and community fatigue.
   - LHJs typically engage a broad array of community stakeholders; counties are expected to leverage this engagement and incorporate behavioral health-specific needs identified through these processes into their IPs.
   - Counties must continue to meet any additional stakeholder engagement requirements beyond those fulfilled through LHJ processes.

5. **Collaboration and Participation**

   - Counties must actively participate in LHJ CHA and CHIP development, including attending meetings and serving on governance structures when behavioral health issues are discussed.
   - MCPs also participate meaningfully in LHJ CHA and CHIP processes, and counties should coordinate with MCPs to align efforts.
   - This collaboration supports coordinated strategies for upstream interventions to improve population health.

---

### **Summary**

The policy mandates that counties engage in robust data-sharing partnerships with LHJs and MCPs to support the behavioral health-related focus areas of CHAs and CHIPs. Counties must identify and align with statewide behavioral health goals, use shared data to inform Integrated Plans, and coordinate stakeholder engagement to enhance community health outcomes.

A key component of this planning process is collaboration and data-sharing between counties, Local Health Jurisdictions (LHJs), and Medi-Cal Managed Care Plans (MCPs). This collaboration aims to create a comprehensive, data-informed understanding of community behavioral health needs and to support coordinated upstream interventions that improve population health outcomes.

LHJs typically conduct Community Health Assessments (CHAs) and Community Health Improvement Plans (CHIPs), which are participatory, community-centered processes that assess population health status and identify priority health issues and strategies. MCPs participate in these processes as part of their Population Needs Assessment (PNA) requirements, which have been integrated into the LHJ CHA/CHIP processes as of 2024.

---

#### Key Policy Requirements and Expectations  

1. **Data-Sharing Collaboration**  
   - Counties must work collaboratively with LHJs and MCPs to determine relevant data types to share, considering the specific nature of CHAs and CHIPs and local community needs.  
   - Data-sharing should aim to create a holistic picture of the multiple factors influencing community health, including behavioral health.  
   - Counties, LHJs, and MCPs must ensure compliance with all applicable federal and state privacy laws and regulations (e.g., consent requirements, California Health and Human Services Agency Data Exchange Framework).  
   - Data may need to be de-identified or disaggregated to protect privacy while enabling meaningful analysis.

2. **Use of Data to Inform IP Development**  
   - Counties are required to utilize and stratify data from LHJs and MCPs to inform the development of their Integrated Plans.  
   - This includes reviewing population-level behavioral health measures aligned with statewide behavioral health goals (see below).  
   - Counties must also meet any additional data requirements for IP development beyond what is provided through LHJ and MCP data-sharing.

3. **Identification of Statewide Behavioral Health Goals for Data-Sharing**  
   - Counties must begin identifying relevant statewide behavioral health goals to guide data-sharing and IP development.  
   - These goals are drawn from a list of 14 statewide behavioral health goals focused on improving wellbeing and reducing adverse outcomes.  
   - Counties are required to address seven specific goals in their IPs, including six priority goals and at least one additional goal selected based on local data trends.  
   - The seven required goals include:  
     - Access to Care  
     - Homelessness  
     - Institutionalization  
     - Justice Involvement  
     - Removal of Children from Home  
     - Untreated Behavioral Health Conditions  
     - One county-selected goal from the statewide list  
   - Counties may select additional goals from the following list to inform data-sharing and IP development:  
     - Care Experience  
     - Engagement in School  
     - Engagement in Work  
     - Overdoses  
     - Prevention of Co-Occurring Physical Health Conditions  
     - Quality of Life  
     - Social Connection  
     - Suicides  
     - Other locally relevant goals (narrative description required)

4. **Integration with Local Planning Processes**  
   - Counties must engage meaningfully with LHJs and MCPs in CHA and CHIP development and governance structures, including attending meetings and participating in subcommittees relevant to behavioral health.  
   - This integration supports alignment of behavioral health planning with broader public health and managed care efforts, reducing siloes and promoting cross-system collaboration.  
   - The goal is to improve upstream interventions and health outcomes by addressing social determinants of health and advancing health equity.

5. **Compliance and Flexibility**  
   - While counties must collaborate and share data, DHCS allows flexibility in how counties work with LHJs and MCPs, recognizing that behavioral health topics and priorities may vary locally.  
   - Counties must continue to comply with all relevant mandates and data requirements for IP development, including those beyond the scope of LHJ and MCP collaboration.

**Section Topic:** Community Planning Process: Local Health Jurisdiction (LHJ) - Data-Sharing  
**Category:** Project Level Narrative  
**Context:**  
This policy guidance addresses the requirements for counties’ Integrated Plan (IP) submissions under the Behavioral Health Services Act (BHSA), specifically focusing on collaboration and data-sharing between counties, Local Health Jurisdictions (LHJs), and Medi-Cal Managed Care Plans (MCPs). The goal is to promote alignment among public health, managed care, and behavioral health systems through coordinated community health planning processes, including Community Health Assessments (CHAs) and Community Health Improvement Plans (CHIPs).

---

### Key Policy Context and Background

- **LHJ Role:**  
  LHJs develop CHAs and CHIPs that describe population health status and identify priority health issues through community collaboration and participation. These processes are tailored to local needs and typically updated every five years, often aligned with voluntary Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB) cycles.

- **MCP Role:**  
  MCPs no longer submit separate Population Needs Assessments (PNAs) to DHCS but fulfill this requirement by meaningfully participating in LHJ-led CHA and CHIP processes.

- **County Role:**  
  Counties must incorporate LHJ CHIPs and MCP PNAs (via CHA/CHIP participation) into their IP development and annual updates, ensuring behavioral health needs identified through these processes are addressed.

---

### Data-Sharing Requirements and Expectations

1. **Purpose of Data-Sharing:**  
   - To create a holistic, integrated picture of community health by combining siloed data from counties, LHJs, and MCPs.  
   - To inform and support behavioral health-related focus areas within CHAs, CHIPs, and ultimately the county IP.

2. **Scope and Flexibility:**  
   - Counties, LHJs, and MCPs are expected to collaborate to determine relevant data types to share, considering the specific nature of CHAs and CHIPs and county needs.  
   - Data sharing should respect privacy laws and regulations (e.g., HIPAA, state consent laws) and frameworks such as the California Health and Human Services Agency Data Exchange Framework where applicable.  
   - Data may need to be de-identified or disaggregated to protect privacy and meet legal requirements.

3. **Data Utilization:**  
   - Counties must use shared data to identify Statewide Behavioral Health Goals and to stratify data for IP development.  
   - Data-sharing supports upstream interventions and population health management strategies that address social determinants of health and health equity.

4. **Ongoing and Iterative Collaboration:**  
   - Counties, LHJs, and MCPs should establish common understanding of data, goals, and language by 2025 to support the first IP submission in 2026.  
   - Collaboration tools (e.g., the forthcoming County-LHJ-MCP Collaboration Tool) will facilitate data-sharing and coordination.  
   - Counties must continue to meet broader IP data requirements beyond what is available through LHJ CHA and CHIP data.

---

**Context:**

The Behavioral Health Services Act (BHSA) mandates counties to develop Integrated Plans (IPs) that align with local public health efforts, particularly the Community Health Assessments (CHAs) and Community Health Improvement Plans (CHIPs) developed by Local Health Jurisdictions (LHJs). The Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) emphasizes collaboration among counties, LHJs, and Medi-Cal Managed Care Plans (MCPs) to promote integrated, upstream, and population-focused health strategies.

LHJs conduct CHAs and CHIPs through participatory, community-centered processes tailored to local needs. These processes involve broad stakeholder engagement but do not mandate specific topic areas, allowing flexibility to address unique community priorities, including behavioral health where relevant.

---

**Key Policy Requirements and Guidance on Stakeholder Activities Coordination:**

1. **Coordination of Stakeholder Engagement:**

   - Counties **must coordinate stakeholder engagement activities for IP development with LHJ CHA/CHIP processes to the extent feasible**. This coordination aims to reduce duplication, minimize community fatigue, and streamline input from diverse populations.
   
   - Although counties are required to engage more than twenty specific populations and stakeholder groups for the IP, they should seek opportunities to **combine or integrate IP stakeholder engagement with LHJ CHA/CHIP stakeholder processes**.
   
   - Counties are **not required to conduct all illustrative stakeholder activities** listed but should select those that best fit local collaboration opportunities.

2. **Illustrative Stakeholder Activities Counties May Coordinate with LHJs:**

   Counties may choose to engage in one or more of the following collaborative activities with LHJs during IP development:

   - **a. Shared Stakeholder Identification:** Collaborate with LHJs to identify stakeholders important to both IP and CHA/CHIP processes.
   
   - **b. Joint Data Collection:** Collaborate on surveys, focus groups, or interviews that inform both IP and CHA/CHIP.
   
   - **c. Co-hosted Community Events:** Co-host sessions, listening tours, or other events to strengthen stakeholder engagement across both planning efforts.
   
   - **d. Coordinated Messaging and Calendars:** Align communication strategies and event calendars (e.g., governance meetings) related to IP and CHA/CHIP engagement.
   
   - **e. Other Activities:** Counties may describe additional coordination efforts as appropriate.

3. **Broader Stakeholder and Data Requirements:**

   - Counties must **continue to meet any broader stakeholder engagement and data requirements for the IP that are not fulfilled through LHJ CHA/CHIP processes**.
   
   - Counties should consider the most recent CHA and CHIP available (which may be up to four years old) and, if unavailable, consult LHJs for alternative strategic plans.
   
   - Counties are expected to work with LHJs and MCPs to share and utilize relevant data, adhering to privacy laws and data frameworks, to inform IP development and identify statewide behavioral health goals.

4. **Governance and Participation:**

   - Counties are required to **participate in LHJ CHA and CHIP governance structures and meetings**, especially when behavioral health topics are discussed.
   
   - This participation mirrors MCP requirements for meaningful involvement in LHJ planning processes.

5. **Flexibility and Local Needs:**

   - Given the unique local needs driving IPs and LHJ CHAs/CHIPs, DHCS allows flexibility in how counties coordinate stakeholder engagement.
   
   - Behavioral health may or may not be a focus area in LHJ processes; counties should work collaboratively to incorporate behavioral health needs identified through CHA/CHIP into the IP.

---

**Summary:**

Counties must actively coordinate stakeholder engagement activities for their Integrated Plan development with LHJ CHA and CHIP processes where feasible, aiming to reduce duplication and enhance community input. This coordination can include shared stakeholder identification, joint data collection, co-hosted community events, and aligned messaging. Counties must also fulfill any additional IP-specific stakeholder and data requirements beyond what LHJs provide. Participation in LHJ governance and collaboration with MCPs are essential components of this integrated planning approach, all designed to promote aligned, upstream, and effective behavioral health and population health strategies at the local level.","### Summary: Coordination of Stakeholder Activities Between Counties and Local Health Jurisdictions (LHJs) for Integrated Plan (IP) Development

#### **Key Policy Requirements:**

- **Mandatory Coordination:**  
  Counties **must coordinate stakeholder engagement activities for IP development with LHJ CHA/CHIP processes to the extent feasible** (W&I Code § 5963.03). This coordination aims to streamline efforts and leverage existing LHJ community engagement.

- **Stakeholder Engagement Scope:**  
  Counties are required to engage a broad and diverse range of stakeholders—including LHJs, families, individuals with lived experience, providers, public safety, education agencies, and community organizations—ensuring meaningful participation in the IP development (W&I Code §§ 5963.03, 5892).

- **Integration of Engagement Activities:**  
  Counties should seek opportunities to combine or integrate IP stakeholder engagement with LHJ CHA/CHIP processes through activities such as:  
  - Collaborating to identify shared key stakeholders.  
  - Conducting joint surveys, focus groups, or interviews.  
  - Co-hosting community sessions, listening tours, or other events.  
  - Coordinating messaging and event calendars related to IP and CHA/CHIP engagement.  
  These activities are illustrative and not all are required; counties select those fitting local collaboration opportunities.

- **Governance Participation:**  
  Counties must participate in LHJ CHA and CHIP governance structures and meetings, especially when behavioral health topics are discussed, to support coordinated planning (W&I Code § 5963.03).

- **Use of CHA/CHIP Data and Plans:**  
  Counties must consider the most recent CHA and CHIP in preparing their IP and annual updates, collaborating with LHJs and Medi-Cal Managed Care Plans (MCPs) to share relevant data while adhering to privacy laws (W&I Code §§ 5963.01, 5963.02).

- **Flexibility:**  
  Given local variation in priorities and behavioral health focus within LHJ processes, counties have flexibility in how they coordinate stakeholder engagement but must ensure behavioral health needs identified through CHA/CHIP are incorporated into the IP.

---

#### **Relevant Statutory Provisions:**

- **W&I Code § 5963.03:**  
  Primary statute mandating counties to coordinate stakeholder engagement with LHJs for IP development, engage diverse stakeholders, participate in LHJ governance, and reduce duplication.

- **W&I Code §§ 5963.01 & 5963.02:**  
  Require counties to collaborate with LHJs on CHA/CHIP development and consider these plans in IP preparation.

- **W&I Code § 5892:**  
  Defines required stakeholder groups for behavioral health planning, including LHJs.

- **W&I Code § 14184:**  
  Mandates LHJs to conduct CHAs and CHIPs with community collaboration, which counties must align with in their engagement efforts.

---

### **Conclusion:**

Counties must actively coordinate and integrate stakeholder engagement activities for IP development with LHJ CHA/CHIP processes where feasible. This includes collaborating on shared stakeholders, joint data collection, co-hosted community events, and aligned messaging, while also fulfilling any additional IP-specific stakeholder requirements. Participation in LHJ governance and use of CHA/CHIP data are essential to ensure aligned, effective behavioral health and population health planning consistent with statutory mandates."

#### Context and Purpose

This policy guidance addresses the requirements for counties when developing their Behavioral Health Services Act (BHSA) Integrated Plans (IPs) to ensure alignment and collaboration with Local Health Jurisdictions (LHJs) and Medi-Cal Managed Care Plans (MCPs). Specifically, it focuses on the county’s obligation to consider the LHJ’s most recent Community Health Assessment (CHA), Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP), or Strategic Plan in preparing their IP.

The overarching goal is to promote integrated, upstream, and population-level health strategies by bridging public health, managed care, and behavioral health systems. This alignment aims to reduce siloes, improve data sharing, coordinate stakeholder engagement, and ultimately enhance health outcomes and equity in local communities.

---

#### Background on LHJ CHA and CHIP

- **CHA**: A comprehensive assessment describing the status of population health within the LHJ’s jurisdiction, developed through participatory and collaborative community processes.
- **CHIP**: A strategic plan informed by the CHA that outlines how the LHJ and community partners will address key health issues identified in the CHA.
- LHJs typically update their CHA and CHIP every 3 to 5 years, often aligned with Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB) cycles.
- Some LHJs may not have formal CHAs or CHIPs; in such cases, counties should review any available LHJ Strategic Plan.

---

#### County Requirements Effective January 2025

Counties must engage with LHJs and MCPs in the development of their IPs, specifically by considering the LHJ’s most recent CHA, CHIP, or Strategic Plan. This engagement is structured around three key areas:

1. **Collaboration**
   - Counties are required to work with LHJs on CHA and CHIP development and participate in relevant meetings and governance structures, especially when behavioral health issues are discussed.
   - Collaboration includes coordination with MCPs, who also participate meaningfully in LHJ CHA/CHIP processes.

#### Context and Background
The Behavioral Health Services Act (BHSA), which replaces the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) of 2004, reforms behavioral health funding in California to prioritize services for individuals with significant mental health needs, including substance use disorder treatment, expanded housing interventions, and workforce development. The BHSA emphasizes enhanced oversight, transparency, and accountability at state and local levels.

A key transformation under BHSA is the integration of county behavioral health planning with broader local health jurisdiction (LHJ) public health planning and Medi-Cal Managed Care Plans (MCPs). This integration aims to reduce siloes, improve cross-system collaboration, and align funding and strategies to better address behavioral health and social determinants of health.

#### County Collaboration Requirements with MCPs and LHJs
Counties are required to collaborate closely with MCPs and LHJs in the development of Integrated Plans (IPs), Community Health Assessments (CHAs), and Community Health Improvement Plans (CHIPs). This collaboration is essential to align behavioral health services with population health goals and MCP community reinvestment planning.

Specifically, counties must:

- **Engage with MCPs and LHJs on CHAs and CHIPs:** Counties must work with LHJs and MCPs to develop and update CHAs and CHIPs, which assess population health needs and identify strategies to improve health outcomes. Counties should participate in governance structures and meetings relevant to behavioral health.

- **Incorporate MCP Population Needs Assessments (PNAs):** Although MCPs no longer submit standalone PNAs to DHCS, they fulfill this requirement by participating meaningfully in LHJ-led CHAs and CHIPs. Counties must consider MCP PNAs in preparing their IPs and annual updates.

- **Data Sharing and Integration:** Counties, MCPs, and LHJs must collaborate to share relevant data, creating a holistic understanding of community health needs. This data sharing supports coordinated upstream interventions and population health management.

- **Coordinate Housing Interventions:** Counties must ensure BHSA-funded Housing Interventions do not duplicate services covered by MCPs. MCPs cover several housing-related Community Supports (e.g., housing deposits, tenancy services, transitional rent starting 2026). Counties and MCPs must establish referral policies and procedures to coordinate housing services effectively.

#### Performance Focus: County Behavioral Health and Medi-Cal MCPs
- **County Behavioral Health:** BHSA-funded interventions (e.g., Housing Interventions, Behavioral Health Services and Supports, Full Service Partnerships) and county specialty mental health services (SMHS) are expected to contribute to achieving statewide behavioral health goals outlined in the IPs and measured through associated performance metrics.

- **Medi-Cal MCPs:** MCPs provide non-specialty mental health services (NSMHS) and cover specific housing-related Community Supports under CalAIM. MCPs are integral partners in community reinvestment planning, contributing to population health management and behavioral health outcomes through coordinated care and service delivery.

#### Challenges and Concerns
- **Alignment and Coordination:** Counties face challenges aligning behavioral health planning with MCPs and LHJs due to differing local priorities, data siloes, and varying MCP coverage of housing supports.

- **Data Sharing Barriers:** Effective data sharing requires addressing privacy, data standardization, and technical interoperability issues.

- **Avoiding Service Duplication:** Ensuring BHSA Housing Interventions complement rather than supplant MCP-covered services requires detailed coordination and clear policies.

- **Flexibility vs. Consistency:** While DHCS allows flexibility in local collaboration approaches, this can lead to variability in the effectiveness of MCP and county partnerships.

---

### Summary Response to Question:
**1. Please list the Managed Care Plans (MCP) the county worked with to inform the MCPs’ respective community reinvestment planning and decision-making processes [narrative box]?**

Counties are required to work with all MCPs covering residents within their jurisdiction to inform MCP community reinvestment planning and decision-making. This collaboration occurs through joint participation in LHJ-led Community Health Assessments (CHAs) and Community Health Improvement Plans (CHIPs), which serve as the basis for MCP Population Needs Assessments (PNAs) and Integrated Plans (IPs). MCPs participate in governance structures and data sharing initiatives alongside counties and LHJs to align behavioral health and housing interventions with population health goals.

The specific MCPs involved will vary by county but include all Medi-Cal Managed Care Plans operating locally. Counties must ensure coordination with these MCPs to:

- Align behavioral health and housing services,
- Share relevant data for comprehensive community health planning,
- Develop referral policies for housing-related Community Supports,
- Avoid duplication of services funded by BHSA and MCPs.

This integrated planning approach supports the performance of county behavioral health programs and MCPs in meeting statewide behavioral health goals through coordinated, community-informed strategies.

---

#### Context and Purpose

This policy section addresses how counties must incorporate the Behavioral Health Services Act (BHSA) community planning process into their Integrated Plan (IP) submissions, specifically focusing on collaboration with Medi-Cal Managed Care Plans (MCPs) and Local Health Jurisdictions (LHJs). The BHSA replaces and expands upon the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) by prioritizing services for individuals with significant behavioral health needs, including substance use disorders (SUD), housing interventions, and workforce expansion, while enhancing oversight and accountability.

The policy aims to align county behavioral health planning and MCP activities with statewide behavioral health goals through integrated, cross-system collaboration. This integration is intended to reduce siloes, improve upstream interventions, and promote health equity by addressing social determinants of health and community needs holistically.

---

#### Key Policy Requirements and Components

1. **Collaboration and Integration in Planning**

   - Counties must collaborate with LHJs and MCPs in the development of Community Health Assessments (CHAs) and Community Health Improvement Plans (CHIPs), which inform the county’s Integrated Plan (IP) and annual updates.
   - MCPs no longer submit separate Population Needs Assessments (PNAs) to DHCS but fulfill this requirement by participating meaningfully in LHJ-led CHAs and CHIPs.
   - Counties must consider MCP PNAs (now integrated into CHAs/CHIPs) and LHJ CHIPs when preparing their IPs.
   - Counties, MCPs, and LHJs are expected to share data and participate in governance structures (e.g., CHA/CHIP committees) to ensure coordinated strategies.

2. **Alignment with Statewide Behavioral Health Goals**

   - The IP and MCP Community Reinvestment Plans must address behavioral health needs identified through the BHSA community planning process.
   - BHSA-funded interventions (e.g., Housing Interventions, Behavioral Health Services and Supports, Full Service Partnerships), county Specialty Mental Health Services (SMHS), and MCP Non-Specialty Mental Health Services (NSMHS) should collectively impact the statewide behavioral health goals and associated measures.
   - The planning process is phased:
     - **Phase 1:** Use population-level behavioral health measures to inform resource planning and targeted interventions.
     - **Phase 2:** Use performance measures to monitor county behavioral health and MCPs’ effectiveness.

3. **Community Planning Process**

   - Counties must utilize the Community Planning Process detailed in the BHSA Policy Manual, engaging key stakeholders including MCPs and LHJs.
   - This process emphasizes community collaboration and participation to identify needs and develop interventions.
   - Counties must report planned activities and expenditures across multiple funding sources, including BHSA funds, Medi-Cal behavioral health programs (SMHS, Drug Medi-Cal), realignment funds, federal block grants, and others.

4. **Housing Interventions Coordination**

   - BHSA Housing Interventions funds **cannot** be used for housing services covered by MCPs.
   - Counties must coordinate closely with MCPs to ensure BHSA Housing Interventions complement, not supplant, MCP-covered housing-related Community Supports.
   - This coordination maximizes the use of BHSA funds and facilitates referrals to MCP services such as Enhanced Care Management.

5. **Data Sharing and Governance**

   - Counties, MCPs, and LHJs must collaborate on data sharing to create a comprehensive understanding of community health needs.
   - Data sharing must respect privacy and be tailored to local needs.
   - Counties are expected to participate in CHA/CHIP governance and meetings relevant to behavioral health.

6. **Flexibility and Local Variation**

   - While collaboration is required, DHCS allows flexibility in how counties engage with MCPs and LHJs, recognizing local differences in behavioral health priorities and community needs.

---

#### Summary of Performance Focus

- **County Behavioral Health Departments** are responsible for developing and implementing BHSA-funded interventions, SMHS, and other behavioral health services aligned with statewide goals.
- **Medi-Cal MCPs** are responsible for providing NSMHS and housing-related Community Supports, participating in LHJ-led CHAs and CHIPs, and aligning their Population Health Management strategies with county and LHJ plans.
- Both entities must work collaboratively to address behavioral health needs identified through the BHSA community planning process and reflected in the Integrated Plan.
- Performance monitoring will evolve from population-level measures to specific accountability metrics for counties and MCPs.

---

### In Response to the Question:

**Which activities in the MCP Community Reinvestment Plan submissions address needs identified through the BHSA community planning process and collaboration between the county, MCP, and other stakeholders on the county’s Integrated Plan?**

- MCP Community Reinvestment Plan activities must reflect behavioral health needs identified through the BHSA community planning process, which includes participation in LHJ CHAs and CHIPs.
- Activities should align with statewide behavioral health goals and measures, including interventions addressing housing, behavioral health services, and supports.
- MCPs must coordinate with counties to ensure their Community Supports complement BHSA-funded Housing Interventions.
- MCPs’ meaningful participation in local planning processes (CHA/CHIP governance, data sharing, and strategy development) is a key activity demonstrating alignment.
- MCPs’ NSMHS and housing-related Community Supports should be designed to impact the goals outlined in the Integrated Plan, which is informed by BHSA community planning.
- The narrative should describe how MCP activities integrate with county behavioral health SMHS and BHSA-funded programs to collectively improve behavioral health outcomes.

---

### Key Policy Requirements and Process:

1. **Integrated Plan (IP) Submission and Approval:**
   - Counties must submit a **draft IP by March 31** of the fiscal year prior to the plan period, and a **final IP by June 30**.
   - The draft IP must include all planned behavioral health activities and projected expenditures across all relevant funding sources (e.g., 1991 and 2011 Realignment, Medi-Cal Specialty Mental Health Services, Drug Medi-Cal, federal block grants, BHSA funds, county general funds, opioid settlement funds, etc.).
   - The final IP must be approved by the **county Board of Supervisors** and certified by the **county Behavioral Health Director**.
   - The IP must undergo a **30-day public comment period** and a **public hearing** by the local Behavioral Health Board before final submission.

     - The county has complied with all applicable regulations, laws, and statutes.
     - All planned expenditures are consistent with state and federal fiscal accountability requirements.
   - This certification is a mandatory component of the final IP submission package.

3. **Additional Certifications:**
   - The County Administrative Officer, Chief Executive Officer, or designee must also certify fiscal accountability and compliance.
   - The county Board of Supervisors must certify that the county will meet its realignment obligations.

4. **Counties with Separate Mental Health (MH) and Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Directors:**

   - The joint IP must report combined planned activities and expenditures for both MH and SUD services.
   - Counties may optionally provide **additional contact information**, including email addresses, for the separate MH and SUD directors to facilitate communication and coordination.
   - The joint IP must ensure data is unduplicated and reflect the combined service population and expenditures.

5. **DHCS Review and Compliance Monitoring:**
   - DHCS reviews draft and final IPs for completeness, alignment with statutory requirements, and consistency with statewide behavioral health goals.
   - DHCS may flag county submissions for follow-up to provide technical assistance or recommend plan revisions.
   - DHCS may require counties to revise their IP if it does not adequately address local behavioral health needs, disparities, or funding allocations.

6. **Plan Content and Reporting:**
   - The IP must include detailed narrative responses and budget templates aligned with the Behavioral Health Care Continuum categories.
   - Counties must report planned expenditures separately for MH and SUD services but combined in the joint IP.
   - The IP must address local behavioral health needs, including prevalence, unmet needs, disparities, homelessness counts, and funding allocations.

---

### Summary of Contact Information Requirement (Specific to Question 11):

- While the primary IP submission requires certification and approval from the Behavioral Health Director and County Administrative Officer, counties with **separate MH and SUD directors** may **optionally include additional contact information**, such as email addresses, for these directors.

Counties must submit a **three-year Integrated Plan (IP)** describing how they will allocate and spend BHSA and other behavioral health funds to serve eligible populations, including those with mental health and substance use disorders. The IP serves as a comprehensive spending and service delivery plan that aligns with statewide behavioral health goals and local needs.

---

#### Key Certification Requirements for County Administrator or Designee:

When certifying the plan, the County Administrator or designee must attest to the following (multi-select certification):

a. **Use of BHSA funds to serve targeted populations as described in statute:**  
- Counties certify that BHSA funds will be used to serve individuals who meet eligibility criteria under Welfare & Institutions Code § 5892, including uninsured individuals.  
- BHSA funds may support behavioral health programs authorized under federal or state laws, including financing non-federal shares for Medi-Cal and other federal matching grants, subject to compliance with program requirements.

b. **Behavioral Health funding from all sources will be spent only on allowable uses as stated in statute:**  
- Counties must ensure all behavioral health funding, including BHSA, Medi-Cal, realignment, federal grants, and other sources, are used consistent with applicable laws and regulations.  
- This includes compliance with permissible uses, maintenance of effort, non-supplantation rules, and payer of last resort requirements.

c. **BHSA funding will supplement, not supplant, other funding available from existing state or county funds for mental health or substance use disorder treatment services:**  
- BHSA funds cannot replace existing state or county funds previously used for these services, except for 2011 realignment funds from the Behavioral Health Subaccount or Behavioral Health Services Growth Special Account, where the non-supplant rule does not apply.  
- Counties must optimize the use of other funding sources (e.g., Medi-Cal, federal block grants, opioid settlement funds) but are not required to exhaust these before using BHSA funds.

---

#### Additional Policy Highlights:

- **Fiscal Accountability:**  
  Counties must certify that planned expenditures are consistent with state and federal law and fiscal accountability requirements. This includes compliance by both county-operated and county-contracted providers.

- **Allocation Requirements:**  
  Counties must allocate at least 35% of their BHSA funds to Behavioral Health Services and Supports (BHSS), with specific sub-allocations for Early Intervention Programs and youth services (25 years and younger).

- **Integrated Plan Reporting:**  
  Counties must report planned and actual expenditures by funding source and service category in the Integrated Plan and Behavioral Health Outcomes, Accountability, and Transparency Report (BHOATR).

- **DHCS Oversight:**  
  DHCS reviews certifications and may flag county responses for follow-up or require revisions to ensure compliance with statutory requirements and alignment with state guidance.

- **Use of Other Funds:**  
  Counties should maximize other funding sources to support behavioral health services but may use BHSA funds without first exhausting other sources, provided all compliance requirements are met.

---

### Summary:

The **County Administrator or designee certification** is a formal attestation that the county will:

- Use BHSA funds appropriately to serve eligible behavioral health populations as defined by statute.  
- Spend all behavioral health funds only on allowable uses consistent with state and federal laws.  
- Ensure BHSA funds supplement rather than supplant existing state or county funding for mental health and substance use disorder services, with specific exceptions for certain realignment funds.

If the county answers ""Yes"" to question 3, the narrative in 3a should address challenges related to these statutory requirements.","### Policy Summary: County Behavioral Health System Overview – SAMHSA PATH Grant Challenges and Concerns

#### Context and Program Overview
The **Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH)** grant, administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), is a federal matching grant that funds community-based outreach, mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) referral and treatment, case management, and limited housing services for adults who are homeless or at imminent risk of homelessness and have serious mental illness. This grant complements other county behavioral health funding streams and programs aimed at addressing homelessness and behavioral health needs.

California’s county behavioral health systems operate within a complex funding and service delivery landscape that includes multiple state and federal funding sources, such as:

- Behavioral Health Services Act (BHSA) funds (which replaced the Mental Health Services Act of 2004),
- Medi-Cal Specialty Mental Health Services (SMHS) and Non-Specialty Mental Health Services (NSMHS) through Managed Care Plans (MCPs),
- Federal block grants including PATH,
- State General Funds,
- Other local and private funding sources.

The BHSA reforms prioritize services for individuals with significant mental health needs and expand treatment to include substance use disorders, housing interventions, and workforce development. The BHSA also emphasizes transparency, accountability, and equity in service delivery.

#### Performance Expectations and Service Delivery
Counties are required to align their behavioral health services—including BHSA-funded interventions such as Housing Interventions, Behavioral Health Services and Supports (BHSS), and Full Service Partnerships—with statewide population behavioral health goals outlined in the Integrated Plan (IP). These goals focus on improving access, quality, equity, and outcomes for individuals with behavioral health needs.

- **BHSA-funded interventions** must impact the goals and measures related to behavioral health outcomes.
- Counties must use the **Community Planning Process** to engage stakeholders and address statewide behavioral health goals.
- Counties report planned activities and expenditures across all funding streams, including PATH, in the IP and Behavioral Health Outcomes, Accountability, and Transparency Report (BHOATR).
- Reporting includes disaggregated data by age groups and service categories, including housing interventions.

#### Challenges and Concerns in Implementation (Relevant to Question 3a)
Counties may face several implementation challenges or concerns related to the PATH grant and broader behavioral health service requirements, including:

1. **Complex Funding Coordination**  
   - Managing multiple funding streams (federal, state, local, private) with differing requirements and reporting standards can complicate service delivery and financial management.
   - Ensuring BHSA funds are maximized without supplanting other funding sources requires careful fiscal oversight.

2. **Workforce Shortages**  
   - Behavioral health workforce shortages, including culturally and linguistically competent providers, limit counties’ capacity to deliver timely and effective PATH and other behavioral health services.

3. **Housing and Infrastructure Constraints**  
   - Limited affordable housing and behavioral health facility infrastructure impede the ability to provide stable housing interventions critical to PATH’s goals.
   - Capital infrastructure projects funded under BHSA and related programs face regulatory and environmental review challenges (e.g., CEQA compliance).

4. **Data and Reporting Burdens**  
   - Counties must comply with extensive reporting requirements under BHSA, Medi-Cal, and federal grants like PATH, including detailed expenditure tracking and outcome measurement.
   - Aligning data systems across Medi-Cal Managed Care Plans (MCPs), county behavioral health departments, and other providers is complex.

5. **Equity and Access Barriers**  
   - Addressing disparities in access and outcomes for underserved populations requires targeted, culturally responsive interventions, which may be under-resourced.
   - Overcoming barriers related to race, ethnicity, language, age, gender, and economic status remains a persistent challenge.

6. **Integration of Mental Health and SUD Services**  
   - Coordinating mental health and substance use disorder services within PATH and other programs requires integrated care models that are still evolving.

#### Summary for County Response to Question 3 and 3a
- **Does the county wish to disclose any implementation challenges or concerns with the requirements under this program?**  
  - If yes, counties should describe challenges such as workforce shortages, housing limitations, complex funding and reporting requirements, equity barriers, and integration of services.
- Counties should emphasize ongoing efforts to address these challenges through the Community Planning Process, leveraging BHSA reforms, and aligning Medi-Cal MCP and SMHS services with PATH goals.
- Counties are encouraged to highlight strategies to improve transparency, accountability, and culturally competent care while acknowledging systemic constraints impacting full program implementation.

**Category: Challenges and Concerns Regarding Program Implementation**

---

#### Context and Background

The Behavioral Health Services Act (BHSA), effective June 2025, replaces the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) of 2004, reforming behavioral health funding in California. It prioritizes services for individuals with significant mental health needs, expands treatment to include substance use disorders (SUD), increases housing interventions, and strengthens the behavioral health workforce. The BHSA aligns with broader state initiatives such as Behavioral Health Transformation (BHT), CalAIM, and other key programs to improve access, accountability, and equity in behavioral health services.

Counties are required to develop Integrated Plans (IPs) that report on planned activities and expenditures across multiple funding streams, including MHBG, Medi-Cal Specialty Mental Health Services (SMHS), Drug Medi-Cal (DMC), and BHSA funds. These plans must align with statewide behavioral health goals and utilize a community planning process involving stakeholders to address population health needs.

---

#### Performance Expectations for County Behavioral Health and Medi-Cal MCPs

- **County Behavioral Health Departments** deliver BHSA-funded interventions such as Housing Interventions, Behavioral Health Services and Supports, and Full Service Partnerships.
- **Medi-Cal Managed Care Plans (MCPs)** provide Non-Specialty Mental Health Services (NSMHS) and Non-Specialty SUD services.
- Both county behavioral health SMHS and Medi-Cal MCP NSMHS are expected to contribute to achieving the statewide behavioral health goals outlined in the Population Behavioral Health Framework (Section C.3).
- Counties must report expenditures and service delivery aligned with the Behavioral Health Care Continuum, disaggregated by age groups and service categories.

---

#### Key Implementation Requirements and Challenges

1. **Integration and Coordination**  
   Counties must coordinate BHSA-funded services with Medi-Cal programs to avoid duplication and ensure efficient use of resources. BHSA funds should not fully pay for services covered by Medi-Cal or commercial insurance but should fill gaps to expand access to high-quality care.

2. **Medi-Cal Payment Securing (SB 326 Compliance)**  
   By July 1, 2027, counties must ensure that all providers delivering BHSA-funded services that overlap with Medi-Cal Specialty Mental Health or Drug Medi-Cal services:  
   - Participate in the county Medi-Cal Behavioral Health Delivery System (BHDS).  
   - Verify and support Medi-Cal enrollment for eligible individuals.  
   - Make good faith efforts to seek reimbursement from Medi-Cal Managed Care Plans for non-specialty services.

3. **Community Planning Process**  
   Counties are required to engage stakeholders through a structured community planning process to align local plans with statewide goals, address disparities, and incorporate public comment.

4. **Data-Driven Accountability and Transparency**  
   Counties must submit annual Behavioral Health Outcomes, Accountability, and Transparency Reports (BHOATR) detailing spending, service outcomes, and disparities by demographic factors to inform continuous improvement.

5. **Workforce and Infrastructure Challenges**  
   Counties face ongoing challenges including behavioral health workforce shortages, lack of affordable housing, and increasing homelessness, which impact service delivery capacity and outcomes.

6. **Cultural and Linguistic Responsiveness**  
   BHSA-funded programs must provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services to reach underserved populations and address disparities related to race, ethnicity, language, gender, age, and economic status.

---

#### Common Challenges and Concerns Counties May Disclose

- **Complexity of Coordinating Multiple Funding Streams and Programs**  
  Aligning BHSA funds with Medi-Cal SMHS, DMC, and MCP services requires significant administrative coordination and data sharing.

- **Ensuring Provider Participation in Medi-Cal BHDS**  
  Some providers may face barriers to contracting with Medi-Cal BHDS or enrolling clients, complicating compliance with SB 326 requirements.

- **Workforce Shortages and Capacity Constraints**  
  Recruiting and retaining qualified behavioral health professionals remains a critical challenge, limiting service expansion.

- **Housing and Homelessness Crisis Impact**  
  The lack of affordable housing and rising homelessness complicate efforts to provide stable, supportive environments critical for recovery.

- **Data Collection and Reporting Burdens**  
  Counties may experience challenges in collecting, analyzing, and reporting data required for transparency and performance measurement.

- **Equity and Access Barriers**  
  Addressing disparities in access and outcomes for diverse populations requires ongoing effort and resources.

---

### Summary for Question 2a:  
If a county chooses to disclose implementation challenges or concerns under the MHBG program, the narrative should address:

- Difficulties in integrating BHSA-funded services with Medi-Cal SMHS and MCP NSMHS, including securing Medi-Cal reimbursement and provider participation.

**No other statutes from the provided list specifically address SUBG set-aside participation requirements for counties.**","### Policy Summary: County Behavioral Health System Participation in SUBG Set-Asides  
**Context:**  
The Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Services Block Grant (SUBG), federally known as the Substance Use Prevention and Treatment Block Grant (SUPTBG), is a key federal funding source administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Counties receive SUBG funds to support authorized substance use disorder (SUD) prevention, treatment, and recovery services. The Behavioral Health Services Act (BHSA) and related state policies require counties to integrate SUBG funds into their broader behavioral health funding and planning frameworks, including the Integrated Plan (IP) submission.

**Key Policy Points and Requirements:**  

1. **Participation in SUBG Set-Asides:**  
   Counties must indicate whether they will participate in any SUBG set-asides during the Integrated Plan period. If yes, counties must specify which set-asides they participate in, choosing from:  
   - Adolescent/Youth Set-Aside  
   - Discretionary Set-Aside  
   - Perinatal Set-Aside  
   - Primary Prevention Set-Aside  
   - Syringe Services Program Allowance  

2. **Set-Aside Funding Requirements:**  
   Certain federal funds, including SUBG, have mandated ""set-aside"" funding requirements that counties must comply with. For SUBG, this includes prevention and perinatal set-asides. These set-asides ensure that a portion of the grant funds is dedicated to specific populations or service types, such as youth or pregnant/postpartum women.

3. **Payer of Last Resort:**  
   SUBG funds are subject to the federal ""payer of last resort"" rule, meaning counties must first exhaust other available funding sources (e.g., Medi-Cal, state funds, local funds) before using SUBG funds. This ensures SUBG funds supplement rather than supplant other funding.

4. **Non-Supplantation and Maintenance of Effort:**  
   Counties must comply with non-supplantation rules, ensuring SUBG funds do not replace existing state or county funds for SUD services. Maintenance of effort requirements also apply to ensure consistent funding levels are maintained.

5. **Integration with Other Funding Sources:**  
   Counties are required to optimize the use of all available behavioral health funding sources, including:  
   - BHSA funds  
   - 1991 and 2011 Realignment funds  
   - Medi-Cal (including Drug Medi-Cal and DMC-ODS)  
   - Opioid settlement funds  
   - Other federal grants (e.g., MHBG, PATH)  
   - County general funds and private grants  

   Counties may use BHSA funds before exhausting other sources but must report planned expenditures across all funding streams in the Integrated Plan.

6. **Reporting and Planning:**  
   The Integrated Plan requires counties to:  
   - Report planned activities and expenditures for SUBG-funded services, including set-asides.  
   - Use local data on SUD prevalence and unmet needs to inform planning.  
   - Align expenditures with the Behavioral Health Care Continuum categories.  
   - Provide transparency and accountability through the Behavioral Health Outcomes, Accountability, and Transparency Report (BHOATR).

7. **Consultation of Guidance:**  
   Counties should consult applicable state and federal guidance documents, including the DHCS SUBG Policy Manual (Version 3.2, 2/5/2025) and SAMHSA’s FFY 2024-2025 Combined Block Grant Application, for detailed requirements on allowable uses, set-asides, and reporting.

**Category: Challenges and Concerns Regarding Program Implementation**

---

#### Context and Overview

The Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Services Block Grant (SUBG), federally known as the Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Block Grant (SUPTBG), is a key federal funding source administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). It supports county behavioral health systems in delivering authorized substance use disorder (SUD) prevention, treatment, and recovery services.

Counties receive SUBG funds alongside other federal, state, and local funding streams, including the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant (MHBG), Medi-Cal programs, realignment funds, and county general funds. These funds collectively support a continuum of behavioral health services under California’s Behavioral Health Services Act (BHSA) and Behavioral Health Transformation (BHT) initiatives.

---

#### Key Policy Requirements and Fiscal Rules

1. **Payer of Last Resort**  
   SUBG funds must be used as the ""payer of last resort."" This means counties must first exhaust other available funding sources such as Medi-Cal federal financial participation (FFP), commercial insurance, and other federal/state/local funds before using SUBG funds to pay for services. This ensures efficient use of resources and prevents duplication of payment.  
   *(Reference: 45 CFR § 96.137; DHCS SUBG Policy Manual, Version 3.2)*

2. **Set-Aside Funding Requirements**  
   Certain portions of SUBG funds are required to be set aside for specific purposes, including:  
   - Prevention activities  
   - Perinatal services  
   These set-asides ensure targeted funding for priority populations and service areas. Similar set-aside requirements apply to MHBG funds for crisis services and early serious mental illness interventions.  
   *(Reference: SAMHSA FFY 2024-2025 Combined Block Grant Application)*

3. **Non-Supplantation and Maintenance of Effort**  
   Counties must comply with non-supplantation rules, meaning SUBG funds cannot replace existing state or county funds previously used for SUD services. Maintenance of effort requirements also apply to ensure consistent funding levels are maintained.  
   *(Reference: W&I Code §§ 5813.5, 5878.3, 5891; DHCS Policy Manual)*

4. **Use of BHSA and Other Funds for Match Requirements**  
   Counties may use BHSA funds, realignment funds, and county general funds to finance the non-federal share (matching funds) required for federal grants such as the SAMHSA PATH grant and Medi-Cal non-federal share. This flexibility supports leveraging multiple funding sources to maximize service delivery.  
   *(Reference: DHCS BHSA Fiscal Policies)*

5. **Reporting and Transparency**  
   Counties must report planned activities and projected expenditures for SUBG-funded services in the Integrated Plan (IP) and Behavioral Health Outcomes, Accountability, and Transparency Report (BHOATR). Reporting must align with the Behavioral Health Care Continuum categories and include disaggregation by age groups and service types.  
   This supports statewide goals of accountability, equity, and transparency in behavioral health funding and outcomes.  
   *(Reference: DHCS IP Template and BHSA County Policy Manual)*

#### Challenges and Concerns in Implementation (Typical Issues Counties May Disclose)

- **Complexity of Compliance**  
  Navigating multiple federal and state requirements (payer of last resort, set-asides, non-supplantation) can be administratively burdensome and may limit flexibility in fund use.

- **Funding Restrictions and Set-Asides**  
  Set-aside requirements may constrain counties’ ability to allocate funds based on local priorities or emerging needs.

- **Matching Fund Requirements**  
  Securing sufficient non-federal matching funds can be challenging, especially in counties with limited general fund resources.

- **Coordination Across Funding Streams**  
  Blending and braiding multiple funding sources to optimize service delivery requires sophisticated fiscal management and inter-agency coordination.

- **Workforce and Capacity Constraints**  
  Workforce shortages and infrastructure limitations may impede the effective use of SUBG funds to expand or enhance services.

- **Data Reporting and Transparency Burden**  
  The detailed reporting requirements, while critical for accountability, may strain county administrative resources.

### Summary for Question 2 (Disclosure of Implementation Challenges)

**Does the county wish to disclose any implementation challenges or concerns with the requirements under this program?**  
- **Yes/No** (If Yes, narrative below)

**2a. Description of Challenges and Concerns:**  
Counties often face challenges related to the strict federal requirements governing SUBG funds, including the ""payer of last resort"" rule, which requires exhausting other funding sources before using SUBG funds, limiting flexibility. Set-aside mandates for prevention and perinatal services can restrict local discretion in fund allocation. Additionally, counties must maintain non-supplantation of existing funds and meet matching fund obligations, which can be difficult in resource-constrained environments. Coordinating multiple funding streams to comply with blending and braiding policies adds administrative complexity. Workforce shortages and limited behavioral health infrastructure further complicate effective program implementation. Finally, comprehensive reporting and transparency requirements, while essential for accountability, increase administrative workload.

#### Context and Key Program Requirements

- **SUBG Overview:**  
  The Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Services Block Grant (SUBG), administered by SAMHSA, provides federal funding to counties for authorized substance use disorder (SUD) prevention, treatment, and recovery services. Counties combine SUBG funds with other federal, state, and local resources (e.g., MHBG, Medi-Cal, BHSA funds) to support a continuum of behavioral health services under California’s BHSA and Behavioral Health Transformation initiatives.

- **Strict Federal and State Compliance Requirements:**  
  1. **Payer of Last Resort:**  
     SUBG funds must only be used after exhausting all other funding sources (Medi-Cal, commercial insurance, other federal/state/local funds). This limits flexibility in fund use and requires diligent coordination.  
     *(45 CFR § 96.137; DHCS SUBG Policy Manual)*

  2. **Set-Aside Funding:**  
     Specific portions of SUBG funds must be reserved for prevention and perinatal services, constraining counties’ ability to reallocate funds based on local priorities.  
     *(SAMHSA FFY 2024-2025 Combined Block Grant Application)*

  3. **Non-Supplantation and Maintenance of Effort:**  
     Counties cannot use SUBG funds to replace existing state or county funds for SUD services and must maintain consistent funding levels.  
     *(W&I Code §§ 5813.5, 5878.3, 5891)*

  4. **Matching Fund Requirements:**  
     Counties must secure sufficient non-federal matching funds, often using BHSA, realignment, or county general funds, which can be challenging in resource-limited settings.  
     *(DHCS BHSA Fiscal Policies)*

  5. **Reporting and Transparency:**  
     Counties must submit detailed Integrated Plans and Behavioral Health Outcomes reports, including disaggregated data by age and service type, ensuring accountability and equity.  
     *(W&I Code § 5963; DHCS IP Template)*

#### Common Implementation Challenges and Concerns

- **Administrative Complexity:**  
  Navigating multiple overlapping federal and state requirements (payer of last resort, set-asides, non-supplantation) creates significant administrative burden and limits funding flexibility.

- **Funding Constraints:**  
  Set-aside mandates and matching fund obligations restrict counties’ ability to respond to emerging local needs, especially where general fund resources are scarce.

- **Coordination Across Funding Streams:**  
  Blending and braiding various funding sources require sophisticated fiscal management and inter-agency collaboration.

- **Workforce and Infrastructure Limitations:**  
  Shortages in qualified behavioral health staff and limited infrastructure hinder effective expansion or enhancement of services.

- **Reporting Burden:**  
  Detailed data collection and reporting requirements, while essential for transparency, increase workload on county administrative resources.

---

#### Relevant Statutory Requirements Impacting Implementation

- **W&I Code § 5963 (Behavioral Health Subaccount):**  
  Requires counties to use local SUD data for planning, engage stakeholders, provide public comment opportunities, and submit Integrated Plans and expenditure reports. Challenges include data collection, stakeholder engagement, and meeting transparency standards.

- **W&I Code § 5891:**  
  Mandates good faith efforts to bill commercial insurance before using BHSA funds, posing challenges in billing coordination and reimbursement management.

- **W&I Code § 5830:**  
  Governs housing interventions linked to behavioral health, requiring compliance with Housing First principles and nondiscrimination, which may be difficult to implement fully.

- **W&I Code §§ 5840 and 5892:**  
  Require culturally and linguistically appropriate services and outreach, addressing disparities and tailoring programs to diverse populations, which can be resource-intensive.

- **W&I Code § 14184:**  
  Emphasizes use of evidence-based practices and addressing high-risk populations, requiring consistent program quality and capacity.
