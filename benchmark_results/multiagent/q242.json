Outreach and Engagement (O&E) activities are recommended to enhance service delivery (Policy Manual Section 7.A.3).\n\n### Action Items for County\n1. Allocate 35% of the Behavioral Health Services Fund to FSP programs and document this allocation (by December 2023).\n2. Identify and establish the three specific requirements for providers under BHSA funding (by January 2024).\n3. Implement two levels of coordinated care (ACT and ICM) for eligible adults and older adults (by March 2024).\n4. Develop a plan for Outreach and Engagement activities to identify and engage individuals in the behavioral health system (by April 2024).\n\n### Open Questions / Ambiguities\n- Clarification is needed on the specific \"three requirements\" that providers must meet under BHSA funding.\n- Guidance is lacking on how to measure the effectiveness of Outreach and Engagement activities funded by BHSS.
