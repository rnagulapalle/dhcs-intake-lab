Identify and list all FDA-approved MAT options to be offered, including buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone, and any other forms (by January 2024).\n2. Develop and implement a comprehensive initiative that includes targeted outreach, mobile field-based programs, and open-access clinics to enhance MAT access (by March 2024).\n3.
