It is also required that counties adhere to standards of care for FSP programs, which includes outpatient mental health and SUD services.\n\n### Action Items for County\n1. Identify and document all service types provided under the BHSS funded Adult and Older Adult System of Care (by December 2023).\n2. Ensure that all services align with the required standards of care as outlined in the policy manual (ongoing).\n3. Begin collecting data on the service types offered to ensure compliance with BHSS requirements (immediate).\n4.
