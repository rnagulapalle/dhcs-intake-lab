Conduct community engagement sessions to gather input on potential additional priority uses for EI funds (by December 2023).\n2. Document any identified additional priorities, including justification and metrics for effectiveness, and prepare for inclusion in the next BHOATR submission (by January 2024).\n3. Establish a process for ongoing review of additional priorities to ensure they align with community needs and behavioral health trends (ongoing).\n4. Develop a framework for assessing the effectiveness of newly identified priorities, seeking guidance from DHCS if needed (by February 2024).\n\n### Open Questions / Ambiguities\n- Clarification is needed on what constitutes \"additional priority uses\" beyond those listed in Section A.7.2.\n- Guidance on acceptable metrics and evaluation methods for assessing the effectiveness of newly identified priorities is not explicitly detailed. Further direction from DHCS may be required.",
