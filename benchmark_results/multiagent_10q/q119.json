Additionally, counties must allocate unspent MHSA funds to these components in compliance with suballocation requirements (Policy Manual Section 6.B.1). While counties must document intended outcomes focusing on measurable impacts, they should also engage stakeholders to tailor projects to community needs.\n\n### Action Items for County\n1. Identify and select innovative behavioral health projects to pilot, ensuring they align with BHSA funding components (by June 2026).\n2. Develop a framework for documenting intended outcomes, focusing on measurable impacts on service delivery and client outcomes (by July 2026).\n3. Allocate any unspent MHSA funds to BHSA components, ensuring compliance with population-specific requirements (ongoing).\n4. Engage community stakeholders in the project development process to address local needs and gather input (by June 2026).\n\n### Open Questions / Ambiguities\n- What specific criteria should counties use to measure the effectiveness of innovative projects?\n- What are the detailed reporting requirements for counties post-implementation of these projects? Further guidance from DHCS is needed.",
