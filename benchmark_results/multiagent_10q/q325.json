W&I Code \u00a7 5899 requires rapid access to all FDA-approved MAT and the establishment of data-informed outreach initiatives. W&I Code \u00a7 5891 emphasizes the use of data to identify gaps in MAT resources, while W&I Code \u00a7 5830 requires cultural competence in service delivery.\n\n### Policy Guidance\nThe DHCS Policy Manual states counties \"must\" provide rapid access to MAT and \"should\" conduct ongoing, data-informed outreach to engage eligible individuals. It is recommended that counties map current MAT resources, identify high-risk populations, and enhance outreach strategies through collaboration with existing programs.\n\n### Action Items for County\n1. Map existing MAT programs and providers against estimated community needs, focusing on high-risk groups (by June 2024).\n2. Collect and analyze data on current MAT service utilization and identify gaps in service delivery (ongoing).\n3. Develop a targeted outreach plan that includes mobile field-based teams to provide MAT directly in the community (by September 2024).\n4. Ensure all outreach strategies comply with confidentiality requirements and are culturally competent (ongoing).\n5. Document findings and strategies in a report to be shared with stakeholders and the community (by December 2024).\n\n### Open Questions / Ambiguities\n- What specific metrics should counties use to assess the gap between current MAT resources and estimated needs?\n- Guidance on measuring the effectiveness of outreach efforts and mobile field-based programs is needed.",
